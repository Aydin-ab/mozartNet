This is where I keep all the dataset used for the project.

*./all* contains MIDI files from multiple classical music artists scrapped from [piano-midi.de](http://www.piano-midi.de). 
*./mozart_requiem_mp3* contains MP3 files of Mozart's Requiem download from [free-scores](https://m.free-scores.com/download-sheet-music.php?partition=63401) 
*./mozart_midi* contains MIDI files of Mozart's music (Requiem + other). The Requiem midi files are converted from the MP3 files using this converter [bearaudiotool.com](https://www.bearaudiotool.com/fr/mp3-to-midi) so it might not be the best quality
